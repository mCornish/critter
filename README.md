# Critter
A companion app for the web show [Critical Role](http://critrole.com). After a conversation with someone working on the show, we decided it best if I don't release this project with any sort of branding tied to the show. I'd like to work on removing the branding at some point (and remove MeteorJS from the picture), but I don't have time to work on that right now.

## Demo
I don't use MeteorJS anymore, so deploying a working demo is something I'll have to set some time aside for in the future. For now, I have these admittedly limited gifs.
